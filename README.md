## Introduction

This project automates the deployment and management of Docker containers using Ansible and GitHub Actions. It includes:

- An Ansible playbook (`ansible/docker-playbook.yml`) to manage Docker containers.
- A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ansible-docker.yml`) that installs required dependencies and runs the playbook.

## Pre-requisites

Before using this repository, ensure you have:

- A GitHub account.
- Basic knowledge of Git, Docker, and Ansible.
- Ansible playbook (`ansible/docker-playbook.yml`) prepared to manage Docker containers.

## Setup

To set up the automation, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
2. **Prepare the Ansible Playbook**:

   Ensure your Ansible playbook (`ansible/docker-playbook.yml`) is configured correctly to manage Docker containers. Refer to the provided example in this repository.

3. **Configure GitHub Secrets** (if needed):

   If your playbook requires additional secrets (like environment variables or API tokens), add them to your repository under **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**.

## GitHub Actions Workflow

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ansible-docker.yml`) automates the following:

1. **Checkout the Repository**:  
   Uses `actions/checkout@v3` to check out the code.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Removes any conflicting Docker packages.
   - Installs Docker and `containerd` from Dockerâ€™s official repository.
   - Installs Python, pip, Ansible, and the Ansible Docker collection.

3. **Run Ansible Playbook**:
   - Spins up Docker containers as defined in the playbook.
   - Tears down Docker containers at the end, ensuring a clean state.
